# Overview

- I am making this web application to sharpen my skills using Java 8, Spring Boot, Spring Security, ReactJS, and JWT Authentication.
- Another reason I am making this web app is because I want a place where I can look for reference when I am planning on building
a new desktop. Basically, whenever someone asks me for help I always like to know what a certain part was priced at or possibly
how much an entire build was at a certain time.
    - I just need a place where I can refer to because I don't see myself remembering exact details for builds for others that
    I have helped. I can safely say that the last two builds I had that I can recall a good number of small details but
    it will get more difficult for me to do so with others.
